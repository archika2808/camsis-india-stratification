# camsis-india-stratification
This project builds a Social Stratification Scale for India using the CAMSIS framework. It simulates occupational interactions, applies SVD to derive CAMSIS scores, and validates them with income and education. Synthetic data is used for demo but can be adapted to PLFS, IHDS, and Census datasets, with CSVs and plots included.
